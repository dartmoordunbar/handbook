# Competence, Awareness and Training Procedure

## Purpose 

To ensure the effectiveness of the IMS and meet the business needs, it is essential that all employees receive training at an appropriate level. This applies to all employees and subcontractors working for Rowe IT 

## Induction 

Induction training is given to each employee within their first week to introduce them to company procedures and working practices. Special attention is given to Information Security and Health and Safety. 

The specialist nature of Rowe IT’s work means that when personnel are recruited they are employed for their experience and qualifications for a specific role within the company. Developing new skills is encouraged and should be discussed in conjunction with the projects needs. Final authorisation for any courses will be given by either the Director or General Manager.

## Ongoing training and awareness 

Training needs for all personnel may be identified through any of the following: 

- Management review 
- 1-2-1s 
- Corrective actions 
- Audits 
- Preventive actions 
- Process changes 
- Legal or contractual requirements 

 Training shall be supplied as and when courses and opportunities arise and when resources are available. All training received by staff shall be recorded in Breathe. It is important that Team Leads and Line Managers ensure that the training has been understood and effective in order to keep track of the individual’s competence. Further training can be arranged. 

Periodically (mainly through Pizza Friday sessions or Slack news), all employees shall be kept aware of the following: 

- The importance of conformity with the IMS policies and procedures 
- Their impact on work activities and project delivery 
- Their roles and responsibilities in achieving conformity with the requirements of the IMS particularly with regard to quality of service and information security 
- The consequences of non-compliance 

## Records 

A record of training is maintained in Breathe along with any certificates from external courses. Renewal dates need to be recorded to ensure future training is managed.
