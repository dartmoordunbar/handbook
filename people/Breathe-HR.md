# Breathe HR

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to give guidance on our hr software - Breathe 

## Introduction 

Breathe hr is a software package which will help us support most aspects of HR and employee data management within Rowe IT.  

## Setting up 

You will receive an email which will allow to you to register and log on to your account. 

Information about Breathe and how to get the most out of it can be found at: 

```
Rowe IT Teams > Organisation Information > User Guides > Breathe Employee User Guide 
```

Unfortunately Breathe does not currently support 2FA so please make sure you use a strong password 

Breathe will allow you to: 

- Access your information and ensure it is up to date 
- Have access to your documents 
- Record sickness or absence 
- Manage holiday (**at present we will continue to use HubPlanner for holiday requests)** 
- Performance management 

## Summary

How we use Breathe will develop as we learn more about it. Hopefully it will be a tool we can benefit from and grow organically. For example; it can be used for company announcements, to store company policies and procedures, suggest ideas and recognise achievements.  

Please set yourself up and make sure you check it regularly. It should send you email notifications if anything needs actioning or changes in your account.
