# Asset Handling Procedure

## Introduction

These procedures provide a clear framework for how to handle and protect Rowe IT Limited's information.

## Scope

The Information Handling Procedures set out the need to define classes of information assets and the requirements on the labelling, storage, transmission, processing and disposal of each class. Requirements may include confidentiality (in handling, storage and transmission), integrity (e.g. validation processes) and availability (e.g. backups). Confidential information assets will be subject to the rigorous treatment set out in this section; however, the principles should apply even to non-confidential information assets.
