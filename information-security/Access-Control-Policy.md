# Access Control Policy

## Introduction

Rowe IT controls access to information based on business and security requirements. 

This policy covers the following aspects of governing IT user accounts: 

- Creating accounts 
- Applying enhanced privileges 
- Changes to users permissions and 
- Deletion of accounts. 

## Scope

This policy applies to all information systems managed by, or on behalf of, the Rowe IT including (but not limited to) those hosted in the cloud. 

This policy applies to all user accounts used to log on to, or interface with such systems. 

This policy applies to all Rowe IT employees responsible for the management of user accounts and the privileges associated to them, specifically those designated as owners of information systems. 

## Access Control

Manual creation, deletion and changes of user accounts and privileges must be carried out by authorised staff. The person enacting any change in a user account must be different from the one authorising/requesting the change. 

Logs will be kept of all account creation/deletion/changes. 

Account details will only be shared with the line manager / or person requesting the new account. 

## Managing Privileges 

A user account should have the least privilege that is sufficient for the user to perform their role within the company. Access to information and information systems and services must be driven by business requirements. 

Changes in the privilege of an account must be authorised by the user’s line manager and the Information Asset Owner of the information system to which the account affects. 

Users’ privilege rights will be periodically reviewed. 

Line managers and Information Asset Owners are responsible for ensuring that users’ access rights are adjusted appropriately, and in a timely manner, whenever there is a change in the business need, a user changes their role, or a user leaves Rowe IT. 

Users should be informed of their responsibility to inform information system owners of any change in their role which might affect their privileges. 

## Managing Elevated Privileges 

Users whose work requires system administration access will be given a separate specialist account for this purpose, in addition to their standard user account. 

System administration accounts may use the same password policy as other accounts, but on some systems may have a separate password policy, as required by that system/service. 

In all other ways, these system administration accounts should be managed and the user is responsible for them similarly to standard accounts. When a user logs into a system admin account for the first time they are mandated to change their password before being able to continue. 

Line managers are responsible for taking action to remove user’s admin account when they move roles. 

System administration accounts will automatically be disabled when the users’ standard account becomes expired.
