# Portable and Removable Media Devices Policy

## Introduction

The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) now gives individuals more control over how data is collected, used, protected and controlled as well as the right to being forgotten. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in fines, loss in reputation and cause distress to those whose information has been compromised. 

Due to the nature of portable and removable media devices and the way they are used, they are susceptible to being lost and causing a possible data breach. It also risks the delivery and propagation of malware including ransomware, viruses etc. 

## Purpose

This policy is designed to help reduce the risks associated with the use of portable and removable media devices. It is important that information used or accessed by Rowe IT is protected against unauthorised access or modification when stored or accessed on any portable device.  

All Rowe IT employees and sub-contractors are responsible for complying with this policy and it should be read in conjunction with other company information security policies. 

## Scope

This policy applies to all staff working for, or on behalf of, Rowe IT. It includes both Rowe IT or client supplied portable and removable devices and personal devices used for Rowe IT business. 

Some client supplied equipment may require additional levels of security. This will be dealt with at the project level and the Information Security Officer informed. 

Portable devices and removable mediums include: 

All portable computer devices, PDA, tablet, phone, CD, DVD, zip disk etc, external hard drive, USB memory stick, solid-state or other storage card etc. 

Use of these devices can expose the company to risk such as loss of information, introduction of malware, information leakage, reputational damage and financial loss. 

## Portable Devices Policy

All devices used for Rowe IT business must have full disk encryption to a minimum of AES128 standard. AES-256 bit encryption is applied to memory sticks.  

All phones to have Find my phone enabled or the google app downloaded and activated, to allow remote erase if phone is lost or stolen. 

Laptops to be set up in line with the Laptop Setup Procedure. It is important that BitLocker is set up to protect information if the laptop is lost. 

All devices must be kept secure by the employee, contractor etc responsible for them. When unattended, devices should be kept in a locked area (room or cabinet). 

Passwords are not to be written down and stored with the device. All devices are to be password and/or pin protected in line with Rowe IT's password policy. 

If a portable device is stolen it must be reported to the Director or Information Security Officer without delay.
