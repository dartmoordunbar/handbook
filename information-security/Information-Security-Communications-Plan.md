# **Information Security Communications Plan** 

## Introduction

Rowe IT has established this guidance document to set out arrangements for communication in relation to Information Security. This affects all members of the Company and as such this document is part of Rowe IT Limited's ISMS. 

## Scope 

This guidance document relates to communications related to information security and does not supersede existing arrangements for normal business processes, where employees are engaged in communication as part of their normal business function. 

This guidance is applicable to all communication media, including documentation, email, voice, messaging etc. In all circumstances, judgement should be used to ensure that the appropriate media are used, bearing in mind both the importance and the confidentiality of the information being conveyed. 

## Internal Communication 

Line Managers have responsibility, within the ISMS, for ensuring that processes for information security are effectively implemented. This will entail communicating the importance of information security and, to some extent, supervising the activities of personnel. All personnel should be made aware of their responsibilities in achieving the policy and objectives of the ISMS, and the implications of not conforming to the ISMS requirements. 

The performance and effectiveness of the ISMS is reviewed by the owners on a regular basis. The outcome of these reviews is fed back to all personnel. 

All personnel should maintain awareness of changes to the threat environment, and to newly identified vulnerabilities, as appropriate to their roles. This may include meetings, and briefings. 

Training for employees, and any other persons within the ISMS, takes place on joining the company, and on a regular basis. 

Internal emails, and face to face meetings are the normal method for directed communications. 

Dropbox is used to store and access ISMS documentation. 

Any questions regarding the information security arrangements should be directed to the Quality Manager in the first instance. 

## External Communication 

All external communication must be undertaken with consideration to the confidentiality of information, and the security requirements of the ISMS. 

Customer or other external organisations may need to be informed about breaches of information security. The Managing Director will inform external organisations if the breach has been shown to or has the potential to impact them. Communication should not be delayed where such a delay could increase the risk or impact on the external party. In such circumstances, an information security incident report will be raised, and the incident log should record all activities, including communications made. 

Communication with partner/supplier organisations should be carried out to ensure clear understanding of the information security arrangements of the company. Where the third party is required to implement or comply with information security arrangements, this should be documented, and agreed in writing. This may be within a contract, or other agreement.
