# Teleworking Policy

## Introduction

This document sets out high level principles and expectations that apply to teleworking or home working.  

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that teleworking is undertaken safely from an information security and health and safety perspective. 

## Requirements

### Initial Assessment 

Before authorisation to work from home can be given, information security and health and safety risks need to be considered and reviewed monthly. The Teleworking Checklist is to be used (attached). 

### Workstation

Employees should designate an area of their home (if possible) as their workstation. Working from an armchair, sofa or bed is not a viable long-term option however tempting. Ergonomically it will cause long term problems, so a proper workstation is required. 

### Display Screen Equipment (DSE) 

A DSE needs to be completed as it will help ensure your workstation is suitable and presents no physical hazards. Rowe IT will and does provide you with equipment of your choice. If you have any issues, please discuss with your line manager. 

### Hazards

Please could you ensure that your workstation is free from hazards that could cause slips and trips. Cables in particular should be secured. 

### Electrical equipment 

Please can you do a visual inspection of your equipment and fill in an Electrical Equipment Form. If cables or plugs get damaged, please do not use your equipment and let your line manager know. Work equipment should be shut down and switched off at the end of the working day. 

### Accident

If you have an accident whilst teleworking, please can you let Hannah know. 

## Public Wifi 

### Risks

Using public WiFi comes with risks. These may include: 

- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. These are a form of eavesdropping where vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to get in between transmissions and ‘read’ them. 
- Unencrypted networks 
- Malware distribution due to software vulnerabilities 
- Snooping and sniffing 
- Malicious hotspots designed to mimic a legitimate network which would then allow sensitive information to be viewed. 

Avoid public WiFi networks when you can. If you absolutely must connect to one, don’t do anything sensitive. Avoid sites which require to log in. Browse information only. 

Use your mobile device by tethering to your phone. This is more secure than public WiFi. 

If you require the need to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), the Director is to be informed and a VPN provided. 

**Don’t** 

- Allow your Wi-Fi to auto-connect to networks 
- Leave your WiFi or Bluetooth on if you are not using them 
- Access websites that hold your sensitive information 
- Log onto a network that isn’t password protected

**Do** 

- Disable file sharing 
- Only visit sites using HTTPS 
- Log out of accounts when done using them 
- Use your mobile hotspot or a VPN 

## Authorisation

Teleworking is only sanctioned by the Director once happy that the person has adequate security and health and safety measures in place at their remote location including.
