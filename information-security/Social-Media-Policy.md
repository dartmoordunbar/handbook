# Social Media Policy

## Purpose

Rowe IT recognizes blogs, networking sites, and other social media (collectively referred to as “social media”, defined below) as possible tools to support the Company’s operational goals.  

This policy applies to employees when they participate in social media as part of their job duties. It also applies to staff employees’ participation in social media at any time that they give the appearance of speaking on behalf of the Company or its affiliates; identify themselves as Company employees or as affiliated with the Company; or discuss the Company or its affiliates. 

## Responsibilities

Employees are responsible for the content they publish on social media and should use good judgment. Employees should be mindful that the things they say or do on social media are publicly available and searchable and may be forever accessible, which can be then associated to Rowe IT. 

Comments, expressions, and other postings on social media must be honest and respectful of others; respect confidential, personal, and proprietary information; and comply with applicable laws and Rowe IT policies. 

## Social media definition 

Online, electronic, or Internet media, tools, communities, and spaces for social interaction, sharing user generated content, or public or semi-public communication. Social media typically uses webbased technologies to turn communication into interactive dialogues. 

Social media can take many different forms, including internet forums, blogs & microblogs, online profiles, wikis, podcasts, pictures and video, email, text, instant messaging, music- sharing, and chat, to name just a few. 

Examples of social media include but are not limited to the following: LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, and blogs. 

## Use

Being on social media on your cell phone or computer while on company time, including but not limited to Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Instagram, or Pinterest, is also akin to being on a personal call while at work. Please do your best to focus during your work hours and check these applications during personal time like lunch breaks or at the end of the day. 

Any work related issue or material that could identify an individual who is a client or work colleague, which could adversely affect the Company, a client or our relationship with any client must not be placed on a social networking site. This means that work related matters must not be placed on any such site at any time either during or outside of working hours and includes access via any computer equipment or mobile device. 

## Business use of social networking sites 

Social media can be a very powerful tool and as a Company, we want to embrace its use. We use social media to make our clients aware of promotions and other relevant information and to ensure we maintain a professional relationship with our client you should not add or accept “friend requests” from our clients on your private social media accounts. Only authorised employees can use the Company social networking account. 

Therefore any work related issue or material that could identify an individual who is a client or work colleague, which could adversely affect the Company a client or our relationship with any client must not be placed on your private social network accounts. This means that work related matters must not be placed on any such site at any time either during or outside of working hours and includes access via any computer equipment or mobile device. 

Any work content or material, or contacts or connections list, created by the Employee during the course of their employment, on any of their authorised social networking sites (ownership of which vests in the Company) shall remain, at all times, the property of the Company. Accordingly, upon termination of your employment, you shall hand over to the Company, the access rights to your accounts, together with any work content or material, and any contacts or connections list. 

Please could you use ‘Rowe IT’ when referring to the company. 

## Breach

Violation(s) of the social media policy will be subjective to progressive discipline, up to and including termination.
