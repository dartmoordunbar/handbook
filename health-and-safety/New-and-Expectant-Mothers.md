# New and Expectant Mothers

## Introduction

The **Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations** **1999** include regulations that protect the health and safety of new and expectant mothers who work. 

## Definition 

**New/Expectant Mother**: female employees of child-bearing age who are or in the future could be pregnant, have given birth within the previous six months or are breast feeding. 

## Procedure 

### Risk Assessment 

A risk assessment is required for any female employee who is pregnant, returning to work after giving birth or breast feeding. The risk assessment is not required until the employee has notified their manager that they are pregnant or a new mother. 

The employee should be involved in the assessment and any advice received from the employees GP or midwife that could inform the assessment should be provided to the employer. 

The risk assessment should be subject to regular review during the pregnancy (suggested by trimester and/or in the event of any significant change). 

### Hazards 

Hazards that should be considered for new and expectant mothers include: - 

- Lifting, carrying, moving of heavy loads 
- Exposure to shock, vibration and/or noise 
- Exposure to chemicals 
- Standing or sitting for long periods of time/ long working hours/working alone 
- Exposure to infectious diseases 
- Work related stress 
- Workstations and posture 
- Threat of violence in the workplace 
- Extremes of hot and cold environment 
- Work equipment and personal protective equipment 
- Work at heights 
- Driving 

### Employee Considerations 

Aspects of pregnancy that may affect a pregnant employee’s ability to perform certain tasks at work may include: 

- Morning sickness 
- Backache 
- Varicose veins 
- Haemorrhoids 
- Frequent visits to the toilet 
- Increasing size 
- Tiredness 
- Balance 
- Comfort 
- Dexterity, agility, co-ordination, speed of movement, reach 

### Control Measures 

**Movement and Posture:** A seat should be suitably adjustable to ensure correct posture sitting at a desk. A full DSE risk assessment which includes posture should have already been carried out. A further assessment because of possible discomfort may be required 

New and expectant mothers should avoid spending long periods standing/sitting without regular exercise/movement to maintain circulation. 

**Hours and Structure of Work:** New or expectant mothers may tire more easily and working hours should be reviewed. It may be that working hours need to be reduced temporarily and/or the timing and frequency of breaks as the need for physical rest can increase. Expectant mothers should have access to facilities to sit or lie down comfortably in private without disturbance.

Where possible, lone working by expectant mothers should be avoided or kept to a minimum. 

**Travel:** New or expectant mothers can tire physically and mentally more easily and consideration to minimising travel should be considered. Flying is not normally permitted after 32 weeks of pregnancy and alternative travel plans should be arranged. 

**Chickenpox/Shingles:** Should a pregnant woman encounter chicken pox or shingles infection and have no history of chicken pox they should be advised to contact their GP promptly for advice. Notify any pregnant employee in the event of an outbreak occurring in the workplace. 

**Other Aspects of Pregnancy Affected by Work:** Other aspects of pregnancy and whether they have any effect on the employees’ ability to carry out their duties should be considered, e.g. sensitive to smells; balance etc. 

**Rest Facilities for Pregnant and Breast-Feeding Women:** Suitable rest facilities should be provided for pregnant and new mothers. The rest facilities should be hygienically maintained, provided with access to drinking water and suitable furniture to allow pregnant and new mothers to rest. Where possible, appropriate facilities for breastfeeding mothers to express and store milk should be provided. 

For any risks that are identified, action must be taken to remove, reduce or control the risk. If the risk cannot be removed: 

- **Action 1**: temporarily adjust the employees working conditions and/or hours of work; or if that is not possible: 
- **Action 2**: offer the employee suitable alternative work (at the same rate of pay) if available; or if that is not feasible: 
- **Action 3**: suspend the employee from work on paid leave for as long as is necessary to protect her health and safety and that of her child.
