# Display Screen Equipment Procedure

## Introduction

The Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 seek to protect the health of workers by reducing risks from work with display screen equipment (DSE) 

## Definitions 

**Display Screen Equipment**: Any alphanumeric or graphical display screen including liquid crystal displays. The definition does not include television sets unless they are in use for activities such as editing of material. DSE is generally used at a 'workstation'. 

**Work Station**: an assembly comprising of display screen equipment, optional accessories to the display screen equipment, printers, telephones, document holders, chair, work desk or work surface or any other item peripheral to the DSE and the working environment around the DSE. 

 **DSE User**: 

- Someone who regularly or habitually uses DSE, where DSE forms an essential part of the work undertaken, 
- Where DSE is a specific requirement of the post, 
- Where the normal daily use of DSE is for periods of 2 hours or more uninterrupted. 

## Procedure 

### Hazards 

Hazards of DSE work include work related upper limb disorders, temporary eye strain and headaches, fatigue and stress and conditions related to poor posture and lack of leg room. 

### Assessment 

DSE assessments will be completed for all employees who use DSE as a significant part of their daily work. The assessment should be reviewed in the light of any changes in the workstation or user. Any risks identified must be reduced to the lowest extent reasonably practicable as quickly as possible. 

### Good Working Practices 

Short frequent breaks from the use of DSE are encouraged and at your discretion. 

### Eyesight Test 

Users are entitled to free eye tests. Users may also be entitled to a financial contribution towards the cost of spectacles/lenses depending on eye test result, if vision deterioration is considered to be due to DSE use.
