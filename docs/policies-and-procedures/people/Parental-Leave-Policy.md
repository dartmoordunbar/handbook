- your baby comes early, or 
- you’re off work with an illness related to your pregnancy, and this happens in the 4 weeks before the week of your due date 

### Changing Dates 

You can change the dates of your maternity leave if you give us enough notice. These are the rules but as ever we would want to take an adult approach to it and support you if we can: 

- to start your leave sooner, tell your employer at least 4 weeks before your new start date.

You have to take paternity leave in a block of 1 or 2 weeks as per Government guidelines but we are happy to discuss other arrangements. 

To qualify for paternity leave, you need to: 

- have had the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the due date, or by the time you’re matched with a child for adoption

- you can’t be taking adoption leave - if you and your partner are adopting, one of you can take adoption leave and the other paternity leave

Your paternity leave can start on: 

- the day the baby is born 
- the day a child is placed with you for adoption 
- a date after the birth or adoption that you agree in advance with your employer 

You’ll need to complete your leave within 56 of days of the birth or adoption.

To be eligible for shared parental leave, you must: 

- share care of the child with your spouse, civil partner or joint adopter, the child's other parent, or your partner (if they live with you and the child)

- still be employed by your employer until the week before you take any shared parental leave
