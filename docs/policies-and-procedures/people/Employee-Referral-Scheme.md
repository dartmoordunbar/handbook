## Introduction 

This policy has been introduced in order to say thank you for our current employees who use their personal and professional networks to recommend Rowe IT as a great place to work.

## Purpose 

The employee referral scheme enables employees to receive an introduction bonus when they introduce a friend, family member or other personal contact to Rowe IT as a job applicant and the referred person is then subsequently recruited and employed by us. 

To receive the introduction bonus of Â£1000, the potential employee needs to: 

- Be referred directly to us and not through our Recruitment Company 
- Pass the probation period or an extended probationary period 

There is no limit on the number of referrals you can make but the normal recruitment procedures will still apply so Rowe IT can ensure the most suitable person for the job is employed in terms of relevant experience, abilities and qualifications. 

If more than one employee refers the same job application, the introduction bonus will be paid to the employee whose referral application is received first 

## Process 

When applying for a position within Rowe IT, the referred person should either attach to their CV a covering letter that states your name as the referring employee or make this clear in an email. 

All referral applications will be treated in the strictest confidence. The recruitment and selection process is also confidential and therefore you will not be given any information about the progress of the application. 

Where the role is offered to the referred person and they accept that offer of employment, you will be advised of the introduction bonus date and the date you are likely to be paid if the referred person successfully completes their probationary period.  

All introduction bonuses are paid in the same way as salary using our payroll system. An introduction bonus will not be payable in any of the following: 

- The referred person has previously been employed by Rowe IT or has applied for another job with us within the last year. 
- The referred person applied for the same job independently or was referred first by an employment agency. 
- The referred person declines an offer of employment 
- The referred person resigns either during or at the end of their probationary period. 
- The referred person is dismissed either during or at the end of their probationary period. 
- You are a manager or employee involved in the relevant recruitment process for the job
