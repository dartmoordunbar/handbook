# Travel Expenses Policy

## Scope 

This policy applies to all our employees that need to spend money for work-related activities. We will reimburse all reasonable business expenses after they are approved, in part or in full. 

## Travel Expenses 

Travel expenses include any kind of transportation and accommodation expenses that you incur when going on a business trip. When using personal vehicle for business purposes, the employee is responsible for ensuring that their car is insured for business use and should only claim mileage expenses accordingly.

Expenses related to this category that may be fully or party reimbursable include: 

1. Accommodation
2. Visa
3. Air, train, ship or other transportation fares 
4. Necessary medical expenses such as vaccinations 
5. Local transportation during trips 
6. Subsistence within reason (excess alcohol is not covered) 
7. Mileage will be reimbursed at 0.28p per mile. Mileage is to start from either Rowe IT's office location or home whichever is is shortest (unless otherwise agreed). Where practical and cost effective (in both time and money), public transport should be favoured over private car usage. 
8. Parking
9. Congestion charges 

## Minimizing Expenses 

We want to avoid overspending or unnecessary costs and will always look for best prices. 

Where possible, employees are encouraged to car share if going to the same location unless there is a good, authorised reason why not. 

## Non-reimbursable Expenses 

We won't reimburse the following:

1. Expenses incurred by spouses or other non-employees who accompany our employees on their travels 
2. Unauthorised upgrades 
3. Personal services 
4. Personal purchases 
5. Lost personal property 
6. Fines incurred whilst driving for business reasons 
7. Personal trips 
8. Unauthorised or unscheduled business meetings If in doubt, please discuss with your line manager.
