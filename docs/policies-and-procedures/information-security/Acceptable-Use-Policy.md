## Introduction

This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) details how all used of any Rowe IT device or service must behave. It is based on our values of treating people fairly and like adults. This policy is here to provide guidance. 

The AUP policy outlines the acceptable use of equipment and services and puts in place rules to protect everyone who uses them. Inappropriate use of equipment and services exposes both Rowe IT and our clients to risks. These risks include virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services and legal action. 

## Scope

All Rowe IT Limitedâ€™s assets are within the scope of this procedure (including information and mobile devices). 

## Responsibilities

All employees, contractors and associates (Users) are responsible for complying with this procedure as relevant. 

Directors and Managers are responsible for ensuring their staff and others working under their control are aware of, and comply with, the requirements of this procedure.
