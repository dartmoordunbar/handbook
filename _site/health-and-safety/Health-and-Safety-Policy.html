<p>All injury accidents need to recorded in the accident book. These will be investigated by management to determine the cause and any action necessary.</p>

<p>If an employee informs a manager of ill health which the employee believes to be work related, it is investigated in a similar way as other incidents with occupational health advice being obtained as necessary. All accident records are filed confidentially and retained.</p>

<p>Under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR), the Director has responsibility to report certain work-related accidents such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deaths</li>
  <li>Major injuries</li>
  <li>Injuries to members of the public or people not at work where they are taken from the scene of an accident to hospital</li>
  <li>Some work-related diseases</li>
  <li>Dangerous occurrences e.g.; where something happens that does not result in an injury, but could have done</li>
  <li>Over-7-day injuries – where an employee or self-employed person is away from work or unable to perform their normal work duties for more than 7 consecutive days (not including the day of incapacitation – (Incapacitation means that the worker is absent or is unable to do work that they would reasonably be expected to do as part of their normal work)</li>
</ul>

<p>We report incidents as soon as possible and ensure we meet the set timescales below;</p>

<ul>
  <li>In cases of death, major injury, or dangerous occurrences, we must notify the enforcing authority without delay</li>
  <li>In cases of over seven day injuries we must notify HSE within fifteen days of the incident occurring</li>
  <li>In cases of disease, we must report as soon as a doctor notifies us that our employee suffers from a reportable work-related disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>When necessary we will report incidents and accidents using the following methods;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Online using the reporting forms available from <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/">www.hse.gov.uk</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="aggression-and-violence">Aggression and Violence</h3>

<p>Rowe IT has a zero-tolerance policy with regards to aggression and violence. We are committed to implemented measures to reduce the risk of violence. This is broadly defined as any incident in which an employee is verbally abused, threatened or assaulted in circumstances relating to their employment.</p>

<p>We acknowledge this risk may be present in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>We will identify if possible, situations and persons who may be at risk using our knowledge, information and experience. We will risk assess the potential for harm and implement appropriate protective measures.</p>

<p>We will provide sufficient support to those involved in any incident by discussing freely the whole incident and using counselling services if appropriate.</p>

<p>Where appropriate we will pursue prosecution of any offender.</p>

<h3 id="display-screen-equipment-dse">Display Screen Equipment (DSE)</h3>

<p>All display screen equipment (DSE) users will complete a Self-Assessment Checklist during Induction and on a periodic basis. Wherever issues are identified requiring corrective action to be taken we will seek to resolve these and obtain further advice as necessary. We recognise our obligation to provide employees with eyesight tests and corrective spectacles for DSE work if necessary.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will assess workstation hazards and reduce the risk of harm by using Self-Assessment checklists within 1 week of employees starting work with the company and thereafter periodically or following change</li>
  <li>Any employees who work from home will also be required to complete and return DSE selfassessments</li>
  <li>We ensure workstations meet minimum requirements, which includes provision of an adjustable chair, satisfactory lighting, sufficient space and comfortable temperature levels</li>
  <li>The guidance we provide to employees is to take short, frequent breaks. Each individual user has discretion over when to take their own breaks</li>
  <li>We provide time and pay (where required) for regular eye tests for “users”, who regularly use DSE equipment</li>
  <li>Where it is determined that the employee needs spectacles to enable them to carry out work at their screens (but not for other purposes), the cost of these will be met by the company. The company reserves the right to use preferred opticians for the supply of spectacles in these circumstances. The cost will be for basic frames and the lenses recommended by the optician. If an employee wishes to have more expensive spectacles, they must pay the difference in cost.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="drugs-and-alcohol">Drugs and Alcohol</h3>

<p>Rowe IT maintains a safe, healthy and productive work environment free of the misuse of drugs, alcohol, solvents and related substances.</p>

<p>Substance abuse not only impairs employee health and performance but can also create unsafe working conditions for the company. We recognise that alcohol and substance dependency is an illness and voluntary declaration will enable us to help and control risk. We try and assist those employees who come forward voluntarily with any substance abuse problem.</p>

<p>In order to maintain a safe working environment an employee suspected of being “under the influence”, may be sent home and may also be subject to action under Rowe IT’s disciplinary procedure up to and including dismissal</p>

<p>We reserve the right to conduct searches if there is reason to believe prohibited or restricted substances may be present on work locations. We will support the police where appropriate. The police have extensive legal powers of search including the power to carry out body searches and searches of personal effects provided there are grounds to suspect the presence of prohibited substances.</p>

<h3 id="first-aid">First Aid</h3>

<p>First aid is the care given before emergency medical help arrives. It can often mean the difference between life and death and it can also help prevent minor injuries becoming more serious. We will assess our first aid needs and provision and ensure adequate equipment and trained employees are maintained. We ensure that there is as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A suitably stocked first aid kit</li>
  <li>Adequate numbers of employees trained in first aid to take charge of first aid arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>First aid trained employees take charge when someone is injured or falls ill, including calling an ambulance if required. They also look after the first aid equipment, including restocking the first aid kit. Appointed persons will ensure that supplies in the container are adequate, and sterile items have not passed their expiry dates.</p>

<h3 id="new-and-expectant-mothers">New and Expectant Mothers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We include the new and expectant mothers in the risk assessment and review process</li>
