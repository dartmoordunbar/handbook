      <h1 id="modern-slavery-statement">Modern Slavery Statement</h1>

<h2 id="commitment">Commitment</h2>

<p>As defined by the Modern Slavery Act 2015, Rowe IT condemns slavery and human trafficking in all its forms and will never tolerate it within our supply chain. We are committed to creating a non-discriminatory and respectful working environment for our staff to ensure they feel safe and able to report any wrongdoing without fear of repercussion. Our recruitment and people processes are designed to ensure that all staff are legally entitled to work in the UK and staff are safeguarded from harm. We will not enter into business with any organisation or business which knowingly is involved in modern slavery.</p>

<h2 id="supply-chain">Supply Chain</h2>

<p>Due to the nature of Rowe ITâ€™s business, we consider ourselves to have low risk of modern slavery within the company and the supply chain. Our supply chain is limited with services being supplied within the UK and to mainly the Public Sector through frameworks. All suppliers are risk assessed before issuing any contracts. These assessments are reviewed regularly.</p>

<h2 id="the-modern-slavery-principles">The Modern Slavery Principles</h2>

<p>We will ensure we continue to raise awareness through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing training to staff on the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and informing them to report any concerns if they suspect any modern slavery within the company or suppliers.</li>
  <li>ensuring that Modern Slavery risks are considered at Board level.</li>
  <li>continuing to monitor and assess the supply chain.</li>
</ul>
