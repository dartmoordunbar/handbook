      <h1 id="time-off-for-dependants">Time off for Dependants</h1>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>This document outlines Rowe IT’s policy on taking time off for dependants</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>All employees have the right to take reasonable time off for dependents in the event of any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where a dependant falls ill, is injured or is assaulted.</li>
  <li>To make arrangements for the provision of care.</li>
  <li>In the case of death of dependant (this will be dealt with under Compassionate Leave)</li>
  <li>Where the arrangements for the care of a dependant have been unexpectedly disrupted or terminated.</li>
  <li>Where there has been an unexpected incident involving a child at school.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="definition-of-dependant">Definition of dependant</h3>

<p>This is defined as one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Husband, wife or partner</li>
  <li>Child</li>
  <li>Parents</li>
  <li>Someone who is regarded as part of the family and lives with employee</li>
  <li>Anyone who is reliant on the employee in an emergency situation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h3>

<p>There is no qualifying service period required to entitle an employee to take time off work to care for a dependant but the time off is unpaid or can be taken as holiday.</p>

<p>The right to take time off to care for dependants is intended to be to deal with emergency situations. It is to cover unforeseen events. Please could you inform us as soon as reasonably practicable about the absence, the reason for it and the anticipated length. We will also need to know whether you plan to take it as unpaid leave or holiday.</p>

<p>Please could you complete the ‘time off for dependants record form’.</p>
