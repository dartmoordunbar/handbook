<h3 id="induction">INDUCTION</h3>

<p>At the start of your employment with us you are required to complete an induction programme, during which all our policies and procedures (including Health and Safety) will be explained to you. Information relating to these will be given to you at the induction.</p>

<p>All our policies and procedures are available to view in our Team Sharepoint.</p>

<h3 id="job-responsibilities">JOB RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>

<p>Amendments may be made to your job responsibilities from time to time in relation to our changing needs and your own ability.</p>

<h3 id="performance-and-review">PERFORMANCE AND REVIEW</h3>

<p>Our policy is to support your career and growth via a continuous performance management process so that we can maximise your strengths and help you develop. This is done with 1-2-1s and captured in our HR software, Breathe.</p>

<p>1-2-1s are essentially discussions led by you! Arriving with a list of things you would like to discuss will help you make the most of the time. Some ideas may include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Career and growth objectives</li>
  <li>Training or self-improvement</li>
  <li>Personal or interpersonal issues</li>
  <li>Work objectives</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="travel">TRAVEL</h3>

<p>It is a condition of your employment that you are willing, whenever applicable, to travel to any other of our sites or clients‚Äô sites within reasonable travelling distance as required. This mobility is essential to the smooth running of our business.</p>

<p>However, we understand that sometimes this may not be possible and will try to work with you when this requirement arises. We recognise that flexibility on both sides is key.</p>

<h3 id="job-flexibility">JOB FLEXIBILITY</h3>

<p>It may sometimes be necessary to transfer you to alternative departments, teams or duties within our business. During holiday periods, etc. it may be necessary for you to take over some duties normally performed by colleagues. This flexibility is essential for operational efficiency as the type and volume of work is always subject to change.</p>

<p><img src="images/agile-line-drawing.jpg" alt="agile line drawing" /></p>

<h2 id="values">Values</h2>

<p>Our values are important to us as they define our culture and company. We constantly review them and hope you will be part of that process.</p>

<p>Our values are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Relish the challenges. They help you develop.</li>
  <li>No one knows everything. It is good to share.</li>
  <li>There is not them and us. Just one team.</li>
  <li>We are all human. Be kind and respectful.</li>
  <li>Change is good. It brings opportunities.</li>
  <li>Love what you do.</li>
  <li>Keep learning. Tomorrows skills are not todays.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pay">Pay</h2>

<h3 id="administration">ADMINISTRATION</h3>

<h4 id="payment">Payment</h4>

<p>For salaried staff the pay period is the calendar month. Basic salaries are paid by 28th of each month or nearest working day after of the current month. You will receive a payslip showing how the total amount of your pay has been calculated. It will also show the deductions that have been made and the reasons for them e.g. Income Tax, National Insurance, etc. Any pay queries that you may have should be raised with the General Manager.</p>

<h4 id="income-tax-and-national-insurance">Income Tax and National Insurance</h4>

<p>At the end of each tax year you will be given a form P60 showing the total pay you have received from us during that year and the amount of deductions for Income Tax and National Insurance. You may also be given a form P11D showing non-salary benefits. You should keep these documents in a safe place as you may need to produce them for tax purposes.</p>

<h3 id="timework">TIME/WORK</h3>

<p>Our normal hours are 0900-1730. We are happy with flexibility around when you work as long as it does not make it hard for other people to get things done and does not impact on the business. Flexibility needs to be discussed and approved by your Team Lead or Line Manager first. Please use Slack to keep the wider Team up to date.</p>

<p>Team‚Äôs often have a short stand-up meeting each day. It is preferable that you attend, so if you think you are going to be late please inform your Team Lead.</p>

<p>Generally, we work at our office or clients‚Äô sites. We are happy for you to work from home a couple of days a week by arrangement with your Team Lead. Sometimes you may need to be in the office more often and not work from home. Flexibility on both sides is a good thing but the needs of the client must always be considered.</p>

<p>We are happy to consider remote working requests which will always be subject to business and project requirements. Requests will be considered on an individual basis and will be reviewed if project needs change or end. This will always be discussed openly and transparently.</p>

<p>All absences must be notified in accordance with the sickness reporting procedure. Consistent lateness or absence without notification or reason may result in disciplinary action and/or loss of appropriate payment. Hopefully with the ability to work flexibly this will never happen!</p>

<h3 id="timesheets">TIMESHEETS</h3>

<p>Please can you complete and submit timesheets on HubPlanner. We often work with our clients on a time and materials basis so it is important we can accurately track and report how our time is spent on client projects.</p>

<p>HubPlanner also helps with scheduling work and forecasting future capacity. Keeping your timesheet up to date is an important part of this so please could you ensure it is updated regularly, preferably daily.</p>

<h3 id="pension-scheme">PENSION SCHEME</h3>

<p>We operate a contributory pension scheme with Nest which you will be auto-enrolled into (subject to the conditions of the scheme). The scheme enables you to save for your retirement using your own money, together with tax relief and contributions from the Company. The company will contribute payments of 7.5%. You are able to opt out of this scheme. Further details are available separately.</p>

<h2 id="holiday-entitlement-and-conditions">Holiday Entitlement and Conditions</h2>

<h3 id="annual-holidays">ANNUAL HOLIDAYS</h3>

<p>Your annual holiday entitlement is shown in your individual Statement of Main Terms of Employment. Our leave year runs from January to December</p>

<p>It is our policy to encourage you to take all of your holiday entitlement in the current holiday year. Where agreed, we are happy for up to five days‚Äô annual leave to be carried forward or for you to be paid for any untaken leave.</p>

<h3 id="booking-time-off">BOOKING TIME OFF</h3>

<p>You must complete the holiday request via HubPlanner and have it authorised before you make any firm holiday arrangements.</p>

<p>Holiday dates will normally be allocated on a ‚Äúfirst come - first served‚Äù basis whilst ensuring that operational efficiency and appropriate staffing levels are maintained throughout the year.</p>

<p>If you wish to take more than two weeks consecutively, please check with the General Manager first to ensure that this doesn‚Äôt adversely affect the projects you are working on.</p>

<p>To help with scheduling, we ask you give at least four weeks‚Äô notice of your intention to take holidays of a week or more and one week‚Äôs notice for odd single days. If in doubt, check with your tech lead or line manager.</p>

<h2 id="sicknessinjury-payments-and-conditions">Sickness/Injury Payments and Conditions</h2>

<h3 id="notification-of-incapacity-for-work">NOTIFICATION OF INCAPACITY FOR WORK</h3>

<p>If you are sick, please could you let us know by 10am, or as soon as is reasonably practical. A telephone call is preferable. Also let your Team Lead know.</p>

<p>You should try to give some indication of your expected return date and notify us as soon as possible if this date changes. The notification procedures should be followed on each day of absence unless you are covered by a medical certificate.</p>

<p>If your incapacity extends to more than seven calendar days you are required to notify us of your continued incapacity once a week thereafter, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

<p>For sickness, our HR system Breathe needs to be completed.</p>

<h3 id="evidence-of-incapacity">EVIDENCE OF INCAPACITY</h3>

<p>Medical certificates are not issued for short-term incapacity. In these cases of incapacity (up to and including seven calendar days) you must sign a self-certification absence form on your return to work.</p>

<p>If your sickness has been (or you know that it will be) for longer than seven days (whether or not they are working days) you should see your doctor and make sure he/she gives you a medical certificate and forward this to us without delay. Subsequently you must supply us with consecutive medical certificates to cover the whole of your absence.</p>

<h3 id="payments">PAYMENTS</h3>

<p>Being sick is not a choice and as a company, we would always want to support you when we can. Any contractual sickness/injury payments are shown in your individual Statement of Main Terms of Employment.</p>

<p>Where the circumstances of your incapacity are such that you receive or are awarded any sum by way of compensation or damages in respect of the incapacity from a third party, then any payments which we may have made to you because of the absence (including SSP) shall be repaid by you to us up to an amount not exceeding the amount of the compensation or damages paid by the third party and up to, but not exceeding, any amount paid by us.</p>

<h3 id="return-to-work">RETURN TO WORK</h3>

<p>You should notify your Team Lead as soon as you know on which day you will be returning to work, if this differs from a date of return previously notified.</p>

<p>If you have been suffering from an infectious or contagious disease or illness such as rubella or hepatitis you must not report for work without clearance from your own doctor.</p>

<p>On return to work after any period of sickness/injury absence (including absence covered by a medical certificate), you are also required to complete a self-certification absence form and hand this to General Manager.</p>

<p>Upon returning to work after any period of sickness/injury absence, you may be required to attend a ‚Äúreturn to work‚Äù interview to discuss the state of your health and fitness for work. Information arising from such an interview will be treated with strictest confidence.</p>

<h3 id="general">GENERAL</h3>

<p>Submission of a medical certificate or sickness self-certification absence form, although giving us the reason for your absence, may not always be regarded by us as sufficient justification for accepting your absence. Sickness is just one of a number of reasons for absence and although it is understandable that if you are sick you may need time off, continual or repeated absence through sickness may not be acceptable to us.</p>

<p>In deciding whether your absence is acceptable or not we will take into account the reasons and extent of all your absences, including any absence caused by sickness/injury. We cannot operate with an excessive level of absence as all absence, for whatever reason, reduces our efficiency.</p>

<p>We will take a serious view if you take sickness/injury leave which is not genuine, and it will result in disciplinary action being taken.</p>

<h2 id="other-benefits">Other Benefits</h2>

<p><img src="images/lightbulb-line-drawing.png" alt="lightbulb line drawing" /></p>

<h3 id="life-insurance">LIFE INSURANCE</h3>

<p>We provide Life Insurance at three times your salary under the terms and conditions of the group policy.</p>

<h3 id="private-medical-insurance">PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE</h3>

<p>During your employment you can be covered by a private medical insurance scheme nominated by the Company. Subject to the conditions of the insurance policy. We reserve the right to withdraw or amend this benefit at our absolute discretion. Further details are available separately.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this is considered a benefit in kind so there are tax implications. These are relatively minimal but it is something to be aware of.</p>

<h3 id="employee-assistance-programme">EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME</h3>

<p>We recognise that sometimes you may face certain challenges in your work and home life that are  difficult to deal with. We subscribe to a confidential and professional life management service which  provides you with a qualified counsellor who can offer personal support for any practical or  emotional challenges you may be facing. The service is initially provided via telephone and online  advice but face to face meetings will be arranged where this is felt clinically appropriate. This service  is totally confidential.

<h3 id="people-policies">PEOPLE POLICIES</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
