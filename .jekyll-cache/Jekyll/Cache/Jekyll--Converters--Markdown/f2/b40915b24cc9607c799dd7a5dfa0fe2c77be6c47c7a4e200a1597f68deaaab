<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this policy is to give guidance on taking leave or when sick.</p>

<h2 id="information">Information</h2>

<p>Rowe ITâ€™s holiday year runs from 1 January to 31 December. You are able to carry over up to 5 days leave with approval. Alternatively, you can request any untaken leave be reimbursed in your payslip.</p>

<h2 id="holiday">Holiday</h2>

<p>If you want to take time off:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please discuss the dates with your team and technical lead so that any impact may be managed.</li>
  <li>Request the leave through HubPlanner. We use the HubPlanner scheduler to see whoâ€™s off and when so we can plan for it.</li>
  <li>Add your holiday to the Rowe IT google calendar.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please give at least four weeks notice if you wish to take extended time off. The odd day here and there is easier to manage and should be fine.</p>

<h2 id="sickness">Sickness</h2>

<p>If you are sick, please let us know by preferably by phone or by Slack if unable to call. Please do not come into the office when sick! If sick for less than 7 consecutive days, please could you complete a self-certification form (available in templates)</p>

<p>If you are sick for more than 7 consecutive days, you will need to provide a fit note.</p>

<p>If you are sick and able to work, you can work from home if you want to and are able.</p>

<p>Please record time off sick in HubPlanner.</p>

<p>If you are sick for a long period of time or have been sick on more than 7 occasions over a 12-month period, we will invite you to a return to work meeting to discuss further. We may agree with you an action plan and/or a review period. We may seek medical advice. Should your attendance fail to improve over a three-month period, we will invite you to a further meeting.</p>

<p>If you have been sick or unable to work for an extended period, we will work with you to aid your return and to make sure you have the support you need. We will be happy to discuss any necessary adjustments to help and if you are unable to return to work in your current role we will consider if there is a suitable alternative.</p>

<p>We will always only consider dismissal after we have exhausted all other reasonable options.</p>

<h2 id="compassionate">Compassionate</h2>

<p>If you need to take compassionate leave following the bereavement of a dependant let your line manager and Hannah Rowe know so we can support you in the right way.</p>

<p>Please record Compassionate leave in HubPlanner.</p>
