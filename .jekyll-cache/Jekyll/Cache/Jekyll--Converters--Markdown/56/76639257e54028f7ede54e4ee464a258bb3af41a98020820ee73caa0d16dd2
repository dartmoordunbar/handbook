<ul>
  <li>Where a dependant falls ill, is injured or is assaulted.</li>
  <li>To make arrangements for the provision of care.</li>

  <li>Where the arrangements for the care of a dependant have been unexpectedly disrupted or terminated.</li>
  <li>Where there has been an unexpected incident involving a child at school.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is defined as one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Husband, wife or partner</li>
  <li>Child</li>
  <li>Parents</li>
  <li>Someone who is regarded as part of the family and lives with employee</li>

<p>There is no qualifying service period required to entitle an employee to take time off work to care for a dependant but the time off is unpaid or can be taken as holiday.</p>

<p>The right to take time off to care for dependants is intended to be to deal with emergency situations. It is to cover unforeseen events. Please could you inform us as soon as reasonably practicable about the absence, the reason for it and the anticipated length. We will also need to know whether you plan to take it as unpaid leave or holiday.</p>

<p>Please could you complete the â€˜time off for dependants record formâ€™.</p>
