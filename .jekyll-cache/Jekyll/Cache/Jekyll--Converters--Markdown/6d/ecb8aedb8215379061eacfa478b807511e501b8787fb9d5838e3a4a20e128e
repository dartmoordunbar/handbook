<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this policy is to establish the baseline for the creation of strong passwords, their protection and ongoing management.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This policy applies to all individuals and groups with Rowe IT user and privileged accounts.</p>

<h2 id="information">Information</h2>

<p>All passwords must be treated as confidential information and should not be shared with anyone or made public.</p>

<p>Passwords must not be recorded unless this can be stored securely. For Rowe IT or customer passwords, the use of Keeper is mandated so that passwords can be centrally managed. Keeper may also be used to store personal passwords.</p>

<p>Use of other keychains or password manager applications for personal passwords on mobile devices and computers are permitted provided that these use strong encryption and a strong password (14 characters) to access the stored passwords.</p>

<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2>

<p>Passwords should be at least 10 characters long with complexity (capital letters, numbers, special characters). They must be unique and not re-used. Personal information should not be used as a password hint.</p>

<p>Rowe IT users are required not to share passwords and safeguard the confidentiality of them</p>

<p>If supported, all laptops are to be configured to allow three password attempts. If unsuccessful the user is locked out for 30 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="change">Change</h2>

<p>The initial or default password provided when connecting to a network, application or other system for the first time should be changed.</p>

<p>Whilst regular change is not mandated, it should be done when directed by the Owners or if you suspect someone has knowledge of your password.</p>
