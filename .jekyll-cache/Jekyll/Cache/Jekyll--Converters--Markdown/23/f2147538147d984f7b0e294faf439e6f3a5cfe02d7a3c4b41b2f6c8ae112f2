<h2 id="information-classification-scheme">Information Classification Scheme</h2>

<p>Rowe IT has an information classification scheme which includes four levels of security classification for different types of information.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Classification</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Public</td>
      <td>Anyone  can read or see the information</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Confidential</td>
      <td>Available  only to authorised and authenticated members of staff. Can include but not limited to user guides,  tender docs, semi sensitive information sent to clients, Rowe IT everyday  documents)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Restricted</td>
      <td>Access is controlled and restricted to a small number of  named, authenticated members of staff.   Can include but not limited to information received from clients or  processed on behalf of clients that generates an output.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Secret</td>
      <td>Known only to a very small number of authenticated  members of staff</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The classification must be included in the document header or footer to ensure that the user and recipients are aware of the potential sensitivity of the content.</p>

<p>Staff should consider the following questions and exercise their judgement in each case:</p>

<table>

      <th> </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Does  the document contain information that originated from an open and publicly  accessible source?</td>
      <td>Provided  the information was not obtained in breach of any confidentiality and is in  the public domain, the document may be classified as Public.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Does the  document contain personal data?</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
