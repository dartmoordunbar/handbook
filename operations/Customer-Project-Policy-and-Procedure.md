# Customer Project Policy and Procedure

## Intent

It is recognised that the nature of the company’s business means that the approach to the development of software will, to some extent, be determined by the client for whom the software is being developed. The purpose of this document is the describe the guiding principles that will be applied to software development activities within in the company. 

## Core Principles 

**Appropriate** - The approach taken to any project undertaken by the company will be appropriate for that project, considering the needs of the client, completeness of requirements and any constraints relating to security, technology and personnel. 

**Iterative** - The project will deliver the outcomes agreed with the client, while accepting that these may change during the project, such changes will be recorded and tracked. Clients will be encouraged to engage in an iterative approach where appropriate. 

**Quality** - Any outcome will be of an appropriate level of quality, as agreed with the client and procedures put in place to allow the reporting and tracking of defects. 

**Sustainable** - Where the outcome is expected to be used, supported and enhanced over time it will be designed with maintenance and sustainability in mind. 

**Secure** - Any security requirements relating to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data processed and stored by any software developed or used during the project will be highlighted during the project initiation, any security incidents occurring during development or in latter, agreed, support phases will be recorded in line with the company’s ISO 27001 polices. 

## Project Phases 

Any project will have several high-level phases, these reflect the commercial situation at different stages and the approach to the management of the project. 

## Initiation 

All projects will have an initiation phase. The purpose of this phase is to determine: 

- Overall objective of the project 
- Identify client stakeholders 
- Identify company and client’s roles and responsibilities
- How the subsequent phases will be managed. 
  - Development activities 
    - Stakeholder engagement 
    - Development Process 
    - Requirements capture 
    - Progress tracking and reporting including KPIs 
    - Release strategy
    - Outcome acceptance criteria 
  - Support activities
    - Issue reporting and tracking including KPIs
    - Agree service levels 
- Identify any risks and record these in a risk log along with possible mitigations
  - Security
  - Technical 
  - Critical personnel (RACI chart)
  - Commercial 
- Identify the communications channels to be used
  - Regular meetings
  - Email, messaging
  - Task and issue tracking 
- Commercial 
  - Project costs (resourcing)
  - Capital costs 
    - Software
    - Hardware 
    - Hosting 
  - Invoicing plan 

- Identify key tools and systems to be used
  - Requirements
  - Issue tracking
  - Source control
  - Programming languages
  - Test tools 

The outcome of this phase is a shared understanding between the company and the client of how the rest of the project will proceed and what the overall objective is. 

## Development

During this phase the project will be under active management to ensure the expected outcomes are delivered. 

For software development outcomes the client may have an existing development policy and procedure that should be followed. Where this is not mandated or available the **Rowe IT** **Software Development Procedure** should be followed. 

The initiation phase will have determined the detail, but the company will ensure: 

- Regular communications with stakeholders via agreed and appropriate communications channels 
- Appropriate periodic reviews of progress 
- Deliver software releases as agreed 
- Tracking of any new or changing requirements 
- Communicating any new or changed risks 
- Tracking of time spent on the project by company staff 
- Tracking of additional expenses relating to the project
- Accurate and timely invoicing as per agreed plan 

This phase will end when all agreed outcomes have been delivered and accepted. 

## Support

This phase of the project is largely reactive with work taking place in response to issues or maintenance requirements. When the project relates to the development of a product there may be a support phase running concurrently with a development phase to support an already released version. 

The company will ensure that: 

- Issues can be reported by via agreed communications channels 
- Issues are recorded and tracked 
- Issues are resolved inline with agreed service levels 
- Respond to new and changing security threats where appropriate 
- Where a service is hosted inform client and any planned or unplanned maintenance
