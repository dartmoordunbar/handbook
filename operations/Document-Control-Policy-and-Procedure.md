### Creation 

From the outset, documents must well-designed using relevant naming conventions and version control.  

### Distribution 

This is when documents are transmitted or otherwise made available to those who need them or are used for operational reasons.

This is when use of the documents can generate business decisions, further actions or provide information. 

### Maintenance

Whilst in active use, the document content should be maintained to ensure accuracy and availability. 

### Disposition 

Rowe IT has a Retention of Records Policy which sets out how and when documents are to be disposed. 

## Document management practices 

The following sets out practices that must be adhered to when creating and handling documents on behalf of Rowe IT: 

- Documents must be clearly named (with date, version number and classification) and stored in a structured manner. 
- Duplicate copies must not be created unnecessarily. 
- Key documents must be stored in Rowe IT OneDrive rather than in a personal filestore. 
- Digital copies of a document should never be emailed to a personal email or stored on a personal cloud-based storage account. 
- Final copies of formal documents must be saved in PDF format. 
- Formal documents must contain version control. 
- Regular audits must be conducted to ensure information is not retained longer than required and remains up to date. 
- Copies of documents (digital or hard copy) must only be taken offsite when necessary. 

## Information Classification Scheme 

Rowe IT has an information classification scheme which includes four levels of security classification for different types of information.  

| Classification | Definition                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public         | Anyone  can read or see the information                      |
| Confidential   | Available  only to authorised and authenticated members of staff. Can include but not limited to user guides,  tender docs, semi sensitive information sent to clients, Rowe IT everyday  documents) |
| Restricted     | Access is controlled and restricted to a small number of  named, authenticated members of staff.   Can include but not limited to information received from clients or  processed on behalf of clients that generates an output. |
| Secret         | Known only to a very small number of authenticated  members of staff |

The classification must be included in the document header or footer to ensure that the user and recipients are aware of the potential sensitivity of the content. 

Staff should consider the following questions and exercise their judgement in each case: 

|                                                              |                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Does  the document contain information that originated from an open and publicly  accessible source? | Provided  the information was not obtained in breach of any confidentiality and is in  the public domain, the document may be classified as Public. |
| Does the  document contain personal data?                    | This  is any information that may directly or indirectly identify an  individual.   Documents  that contain personal data should be classified as Confidential |
| Does  the document contain special categories of personal data? | This information requires  additional procedures to be followed and safeguards   applied  and should be classified as Restricted. |
| Does the document  contain any information of commercial or competitive value? | Any  documents containing this type of information should be classified as  Restricted. |
| If the document was  accidentally disclosed, would it pose a risk to an individual or Rowe IT or  reputational damage? | If the  information could adversely impact one or more individuals or groups, it  would be marked as Restricted. |
